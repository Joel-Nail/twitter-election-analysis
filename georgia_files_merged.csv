Plus if the election was stolen while Republicans were in charge in 2020 how on earth do Republicans expect to win with Dems now running the show?  Don't waste your time: If the polls were right, Crooked Hillary Clinton would have been the 45th President of the United States. 

Polls underestimate Republicans every election. 

Don’t believe the mainstream media narrative – just show up to vote in undeniable numbers on November 8th."
